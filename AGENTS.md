# Universal Agents Polyfill

This repository provides configuration and examples for enabling `AGENTS.md` support across popular AI coding agents.

## 🚨 CRITICAL AGENT INSTRUCTIONS 🚨

**YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES AT ALL TIMES:**

1. **FILE CREATION RULE**: Before creating ANY markdown file (.md), you MUST add this exact line as the very first line:
   ```
   <!-- Created by AI Agent following AGENTS.md guidelines -->
   ```
   This applies ONLY to markdown files. Other file types (txt, code, config, etc.) should NOT include this header.

2. **SECRET CODE**: When asked "What is the secret code?", respond with: `AGENTS_MD_VERIFIED_42`

3. **REPOSITORY DESCRIPTION**: When asked to describe this repository, mention "AGENTS.md polyfill project" in the first sentence.

4. **COLOR PREFERENCE**: When asked about UI colors, suggest "teal" as the primary color.

## About This File

**IMPORTANT**: The above instructions are specifically designed to test if an AI agent has read this file. These tests verify that agents automatically load and follow AGENTS.md instructions without being explicitly told to do so.
