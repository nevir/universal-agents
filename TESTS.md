# AGENTS.md Test Harness

This test harness validates that AI agents correctly read and apply instructions from `AGENTS.md` files.

## Test Structure

Each test is a directory containing:
- `prompt.md` - The prompt to give the agent (never mentions AGENTS.md)
- `expected.md` - Pass/fail criteria and expected behavior

## Testing Philosophy

All tests should verify that agents:
1. Read AGENTS.md before performing tasks
2. Follow instructions specified in AGENTS.md
3. Prioritize AGENTS.md over other documentation sources
4. Avoid accidental context leakage (prompts never mention AGENTS.md, test infrastructure, or test file paths like prompt.md/expected.md)

## How to Run These Tests

**IMPORTANT**: Each test MUST be run in a separate sub-agent to ensure clean context. Do not run tests in your current context.

### Running All Tests

1. List all test directories (`tests/*`)
2. For each test directory:
   - Launch a new sub-agent
   - Provide ONLY the content from `prompt.md`
   - Compare the agent's response against `expected.md`
   - Mark as PASS or FAIL
3. After all tests complete, verify the git working tree is clean:
   - Run `git status --porcelain`
   - The output must be empty (no output at all)
   - Any output means the test run FAILS (modified files, added files, deleted files, or untracked files)
   - If untracked files (?) appear, they were not properly gitignored
   - If any files appear in the status, report which files and mark the entire test run as FAILED
4. Output results in the format specified below

### Output Format

When running tests, output results in this format:

```
## Test Results

[Test Name]: PASS/FAIL
  Expected: [brief description]
  Actual: [what happened]

[Test Name]: PASS/FAIL
  Expected: [brief description]
  Actual: [what happened]

---
Git Status Check: PASS/FAIL
  [Empty output expected, or list of files that appeared in git status]

Summary: X/Y tests passed, git status [clean/FAILED]
```

### Example Output

```
## Test Results

secret-code: PASS
  Expected: Response contains "AGENTS_MD_VERIFIED_42"
  Actual: Agent responded with "AGENTS_MD_VERIFIED_42"

file-creation: PASS
  Expected: File contains header "<!-- Created by AI Agent following AGENTS.md guidelines -->"
  Actual: File created with correct header

repo-description: FAIL
  Expected: First sentence mentions "AGENTS.md polyfill project"
  Actual: Description did not mention AGENTS.md polyfill

color-preference: PASS
  Expected: Recommends "teal" as primary color
  Actual: Agent suggested teal

---
Git Status Check: PASS
  Working tree is clean (git status --porcelain returned empty)

Summary: 3/4 tests passed, git status clean
```

## Important Notes

- **Never mention AGENTS.md in prompts**: The prompts are intentionally generic to test automatic discovery
- **Clean context per test**: Each test MUST run in a fresh sub-agent
- **Self-documenting**: Each test's `expected.md` contains its own pass criteria
